This is an update for the Adelaide track converted from
F12002 by Taencum, originally created by Tantra. This
update was created and tested with Racer 0.5.2 beta 6.
It contains updated shaders, updated special.ini with new
timelines, some updated textures and a couple of other
fixes. To install, just unzip the archive into the adelaide
track directory and overwrite all existing files.

Note: you need the original track! This is just an update.
